We served on multiple leadership boards together in jr. high and high school. We were roommates for 3+ years after college and those years were some of the best of my life. Living in Wrigleyville when the Cubs won the world series, and running to Wrigley will forever be one of my favorite memories we made. Lindsay is truly one of the most successful yet humble people I've ever known. I'm truly blessed to know such an accomplished and kind friend.</p>

We attended the same pre-school through high school and played volleyball together for 7+ years. In college and after, we've had countless unforgetable nights out and kept our friendship strong despite the long distance. Bridgette makes me laugh like no one else does, and she's always thinking of others before herself. I helped Bridgette pick out her wedding dress in Chicago last summer, and I can't wait to see her looking stunning as a bride.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">I've known Jen since seventh grade and was drawn to her since the day we met at volleyball camp. Jen and I became fast friends and I've always looked up to her and admired her unwavering confidence. Jen has always been the class clown in the best way. Every team she's ever been on has benefited from her presence in countless ways. Coaches and teachers were always happy to see her and she's such a gifted conversationalist. Since college my relationship with Jen has stayed strong. Anytime we plan a trip, having Jen there makes everyone's day. Our girl gang would be simply incomplete without her.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">I met Lindsey many years ago when she and my brother started dating at University of Illinois. She's an extremely driven and accomplished consultant at Deloitte and I truly admire her ambition and drive in her career. Lindsey and Ross got engaged this past November and I can't wait to share our wedding planning experiences and ideas together. Lindsey has such a great sense of humor and I couldn't ask for a better future sister in law to stand by my side on my wedding day. We'll be counting the days until their wedding.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">I met Lindsay over 5 years ago at our law firm. We shared an office and have been inseparable ever since. Our ridiculous conversations in the office are usually the highlight of my day. To know Lindsay is to love Lindsay. She knows no stranger and makes friends wherever she goes. Her extroverted spirit is contageous and she's always the life of the party. Even though I'm becoming a real wife, Lindsay will forever be my "Work Wife". Lindsay is always up for a boozy brunch with me and orders a shot of Malort everywhere we go.</p>

She is the mom of our friend-group and is the joyful glue that keeps us all together. Dani is such an incredibly reliable friend to everyone. She's a wealth of knowledge and her curiosity always sparks conversation. She shares my love of fine dining and is always up for a spontaneous dinner reservation. She makes everyone laugh and lights up every room she walks into. I'm still convinced Dani saved our lives multiple times in China and Thailand.</p>

We talk almost every day even if it means roasting eachother's soccer teams. We learned English together and wrestled a little too aggressively growing up. Claus cried more than all of us at the proposal so needless to say he's excited about our marriage. At the time of the wedding, he will be fresh out of an internship where I’m his boss, so we’ll see if that has an effect on his speech. I can't imagine having anyone else as my best man.</p>

Despite his indecisiveness in supporting 12 NBA teams, Sid has been unwavering in his support of our relationship. Following graduation, I've been lucky enough to live in close proximity to Sid in Chicago.  He was instrumental in tricking Laura on the day of the proposal and I still owe him for his help. Sid runs late wherever he goes so fingers crossed he makes it to the ceremony on time.</p>

We made great memories when the four of us were at University of Illinois. He and Lindsey did a great job keeping the proposal a secret for our weeklong trip to South Carolina, a few weeks before I popped the question. Everyone should thank Ross for the wedding cake. I had him place a bet for me on the Bulls making the playoffs 😉 Beyond excited to have him as my brother-in-law.</p>

Regardless of how busy he is as the CTO & Founder of Trala, he is one of the most supportive and present people in my life. Vish referred us to our proposal violinist through his company. We wanted him to play for us during the wedding but after hearing his playing, looks like he needs more practice using his app. Don't let him convince you to too many Tequila shots.</p>

He’s loyal, reliable, warm-hearted, and always makes himself free for a heart-to-heart conversation when I need it most. Some of my favorite memories with Lukasz include swimming with elephants and riding jet skis in Thailand. From his excitement at the proposal to his reaction when being asked to be a groomsman, we’re equally excited to have Lukasz stand with us at the wedding. Let's just hope he doesn't cause any ankle injuries on the dance floor...</p>

Reno brings such laughter to our lives and I can't wait to be re-united soon. Although Reno can’t make the wedding due to his CDC fellowship in Africa, he’ll be there in spirit and we appreciate all the work he's doing there.</p>
